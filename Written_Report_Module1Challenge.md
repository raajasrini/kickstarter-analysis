1.Overview of Project

The Project is to write a report based on the analysis and visualization that I create for the Louise’s play Fever fundraising goal to find out different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

2.	Analysis and Challenges
o	The “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” depicts the outcomes in various states excluding the live state which is a challenge. Year conversion using the function needs to be done carefully.
o	The outcome based on goals to find the condition to report the accurate data. However the challenge is to represent the line graph but manageable.

3.Results

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is 
o	Successful rate elevated compared to failed status but in overall demand increased from Feb to May and start falling gradually down from May to December.
o	No cancelled status for the sub category “Play”.

Outcomes based on Goals 
o	Successful high in less than 1000 and in the range of 30000 to 45000.
o	Failure curve has fluctuations with gradual increase and peak in approximate 20000
