# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
      The Project is to write a report based on the analysis and visualization that I create for the Louise’s play Fever fundraising goal to find out different campaigns fared   in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
-**Theater Outcomes by Launch Date** depicts the outcomes in various states excluding the live state.The report [Theater Outcomes by Launch Date](https://github.com/raajasrini/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) shows the **Theater** Category monthly outcomes with sucessfull , failure and cancel counts. The challenge is to perform the year conversion carefully in all the rows.

-**"Outcome based on Goals"**  to find the condition to report the accurate data with dollar amount ranges in Goals against columns to different statuses count and total projects.  Percentage is provided to showcase the statues. Manageable challenge is to represent the line graph.

## Results
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is 
-	Successful rate were elevated compared to failed status but in overall demand increased from Feb to May 
- Demand start falling gradually down from May to December.
-	No cancelled status for the sub category “Play”.
- Overall, the highest cancel status count is 7 in Jan compared to other months.

###  Outcomes based on Goals 
-	Successful high in the Goals ,range of "less than 1000" and "30000 to 45000".
-	Failure curve has fluctuations with gradual increase from the goals range and peak in the range of 25000 to 29000. 
- 100% Failed in the ranage of "45000 to 44900".
- Cancellation is zero count which is good.
